Sure! Here's a sample `README.md` file that explains how **MinaGPT** works — assuming it is a simple ChatGPT-like web-based AI chatbot built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, possibly integrated with an AI API or mocked locally.

You can adjust or expand this depending on your exact implementation.

# 🧠 MinaGPT - AI Chatbot

MinaGPT is a lightweight AI-powered chatbot built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates conversation with an AI assistant in a user-friendly interface, inspired by ChatGPT.

## 🚀 How MinaGPT Works

### 1. **User Interface (`index.html`)**

* A simple chat window where users can type messages.
* A send button triggers the message to be processed.
* AI responses are displayed with a typing animation.

### 2. **Styling (`style.css`)**

* Styles the chat layout, user and AI messages.
* Responsive design with clean visuals.
* AI messages use an avatar like `chat.png`.

### 3. **Logic (`script.js`)**

* Captures user input.
* Appends user and AI messages to the chat window.
* Optional: Sends message to an AI backend (like OpenAI API).
* Includes a typing animation like:

  ```js
  aiMessage.innerHTML = "<img src='chat.png'><span class='typing'>MinaGPT is typing...</span>";
  ```

### 4. **Optional Backend**

You can use APIs like OpenAI's GPT if you want live AI response:

```js
fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', { ... })
```

> 🔒 Note: Keep API keys safe — never expose them in `script.js`.

Would you like me to generate a working `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` file for MinaGPT as well?
