                We have developed a model called MinaGPT, designed to engage in conversational exchanges. Its
                dialogue-based format allows MinaGPT to respond to follow-up questions, acknowledge its mistakes,
                challenge incorrect assumptions, and decline inappropriate requests. MinaGPT is a sibling model to
                MinaGPT, which is specifically trained to follow instructions and generate detailed responses. We are
                excited to introduce MinaGPT and gather user feedback to understand its strengths and areas for
                improvement. During this research preview, MinaGPT is available for free. You can try it later at
                minagpt.com.

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                We trained this model using simple supervised learning, with the initial approach differing from the one
                used in MinaGPT. In the first method, we trained a base model using supervised fine-tuning: human
                trainers provided conversations where they played both rolesâ€”the user and the AI assistant. We gave the
                trainers access to model-written suggestions to guide their responses. This new dialogue dataset was
                then mixed with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.
                For MinaGPT, a rule-based system initially, we later transitioned to using more complex methods. In the
                early stages, we manually designed rules to guide the model's responses, but over time we began to
                incorporate more advanced techniques to enhance its performance.

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                MinaGPT sometimes generates answers that seem plausible but are actually incorrect or nonsensical.
                Addressing this issue is challenging because: (1) during its rule-based training, there is no fixed
                source of truth; (2) attempts to make the system more cautious lead it to decline questions that it
                could otherwise answer correctly; and (3) relying on manual rule-based training can sometimes mislead
                the system, as the ideal answer depends on the predefined rules rather than human knowledge.
                MinaGPT can also be sensitive to small changes in the input phrasing or if the same prompt is attempted
                multiple times. For example, one phrasing of a question may lead the system to claim it doesnâ€™t know the
                answer, while a slightly reworded version may prompt the correct response.
                The system is sometimes excessively verbose and prone to repeating certain phrases, like restating that
                itâ€™s a rule-based model. These issues arise from biases in the design, where longer, more comprehensive
                responses were preferred, and from over-optimization during the development process.
                Ideally, MinaGPT would ask for clarification when faced with ambiguous queries. However, the current
                system typically makes its best guess at what the user intends.
                While we've taken steps to ensure MinaGPT refuses inappropriate requests, it may still occasionally
                provide responses to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior. We are using safeguards, but we
                recognize that false positives and negatives may occur. We are committed to collecting feedback to help
                improve the system further.
