                We have developed a model called Nexora, designed to engage in conversational exchanges. Its
                dialogue-based format allows Nexora to respond to follow-up questions, acknowledge its mistakes,
                challenge incorrect assumptions, and decline inappropriate requests. Nexora is specifically trained to
                follow instructions and generate detailed responses. We are excited to introduce Nexora and gather user
                feedback to understand its strengths and areas for improvement. During this research preview, Nexora is
                available for free. You can try it later at nexora.com.

                Nexora is in its research phase, available for free. Try it now at <a href="index.html">nexora.com</a>.

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>
                We trained this model using simple supervised learning. In the first method, we trained a base model
                using supervised fine-tuning: human trainers provided conversations where they played both rolesâ€”the
                user and the AI assistant. Trainers had access to model-written suggestions to guide their responses.
                This new dialogue dataset was then mixed with the InstructGPT dataset, transformed into a dialogue
                format. Nexora began as a rule-based system, later transitioning to more complex methods to enhance
                performance.

        <section class="limitations">
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                Nexora sometimes generates answers that seem plausible but are incorrect or nonsensical. This challenge
                arises due to: (1) lack of a fixed source of truth during rule-based training; (2) cautious tuning may
                lead to declined correct answers; (3) manual rule-based training can mislead the system. Nexora may be
                sensitive to input phrasing, sometimes verbose, and prone to repetition. Ideally, Nexora would ask for
                clarification when faced with ambiguity, but it often makes its best guess. While safeguards are in
                place, Nexora may occasionally respond to harmful instructions or show bias. We welcome feedback to
                improve the system.
